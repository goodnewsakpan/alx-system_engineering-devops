#This is a task on 0x0C. Web server

##General requirements
- Is your web-01 server configured according to requirements
- Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (meaning without any human intervention)
## For an SRE, that comes very handy when there are hundreds or thousands of servers to manage, the work cannot be only done manually. Note that the checker will execute your script as the root user, you do not need to use the sudo command.

- A good Software Engineer is a lazy Software Engineer.
